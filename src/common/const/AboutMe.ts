    title: "Who Am I?",
    description: ["Hi! I’m Kaisa, a Bachelor of Business Information Systems with a strong interest in software development. I enjoy building user-friendly web applications, with a particular focus on frontend development using modern technologies. I’m open and eager to learn other areas of software development as well.\n\nI’m currently looking for a junior software developer position where I can grow my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue learning as part of a collaborative team."],
    education: ["I started my studies in Business Information Systems in 2021 without any experience in coding or IT in general, only a feeling that it would be fun to know how to code. After my first year, I was certain that I was in the right place. I chose to specialize in software development as my interests were in frontend web and application development. I graduated in may of 2025 full of motivation and inspiration for new challenges.", "I’ve been a part of multiple client and team projects that have mostly been focused on frontend development. TypeScript, JavaScript, React, HTML/SCSS and Java are some of the technologies that I’m most familiar with. I have also done things with Python, C#, Kotlin and Swift. Github is my everyday tool and I have spent some time trying to become familiar with Docker."],
    workExperience: ["After high school, I was not sure what I wanted to do, so I took two gap years and worked as a Special Cleaner. After gaining some experience and proving my reliability, I was given some more responsible tasks, for example being the shift supervisor.", "After starting my studies, I have been working in two different places during the summers. The first summer I spent as a Bike Taxi Driver. It was a fun job where I gathered valuable experience in customer service. After that I have spent two summers in Tamro Oyj as a Logistics Worker. It is a job where accuracy and responsibility are very important traits.", "Currently I am working as a Lead Web Developer in a volunteer project in Psyche’s Royale Gaming ry. In addition to improving my coding skills, I have gained confidence and learned a lot more about the IT work environment."]
